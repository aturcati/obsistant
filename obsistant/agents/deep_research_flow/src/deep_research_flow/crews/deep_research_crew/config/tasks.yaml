# Define the task to create the research plan.
# This task involves breaking down the user query into main and secondary topics.
create_research_plan:
  description: >
    Break down the research query "{user_query}" into MAIN topics (core
    essential areas) and SECONDARY topics (supporting areas). Clearly separate and
    prioritize these categories for parallel research execution. The current year is {current_year}.
  expected_output: >
    A research plan with: 1) MAIN TOPICS: Core research areas crucial
    for answering the query, 2) SECONDARY TOPICS: Supporting research areas that provide
    context, 3) Key questions for each topic category, 4) Research priorities and
    success criteria.

  description: >
    Using the research plan, focus on the MAIN topics and search the internet
    to collect comprehensive information. Verify information across multiple sources
    and cite all sources used.
  expected_output: >
    Comprehensive research data for MAIN topics including: 1) Detailed
    information for each main research topic with citations, 2) Key facts and statistics,
    3) Multiple source perspectives, 4) Source credibility notes

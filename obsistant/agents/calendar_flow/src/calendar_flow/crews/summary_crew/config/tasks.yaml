prepare_summary:
  description: >
    Convert the structured list of events into a clear and complete report. Divide the report into sections for each type of event.
    Start with the section of the work events, that are given as a list of JSON objects:
    {work_events}

    Then continue with the section of the concerts, that are given as a list of JSON objects:
    {concerts}

    Additional rules:
    - Include only the information from the JSON objects in the report.
    - Separate the sections with a horizontal rule.
    - Each event in both sections should be numbered.
  expected_output: >
    A clear, complete and exhaustive report representing the information of the list of events. The report should be in markdown format. Only include the markdown content, no frontmatter or other text.
